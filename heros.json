The damage \"Crossbow of Tang\" deals will be regarded as Basic Attack damage. The Lifesteal Effect of [Haas's Claws] enables Wanwan to restore massive HP while she activates her Ultimate. As Wanwan could move, remove CC from herself and become invincible, she doesn’t need more equipment to increase her survivability. [Berserker's Fury] and [Blade of Despair] could further increase the damage Wanwan deals.",

CD Reduction provided by Bloodthirst allows mounted Leomord to cast more spells. Spell Vamp allows him to drain enemies’ HP by using skill 1, making it easier for mounted Leomord to kill. Leomord needs to first cast spells to wear enemies down then kill them with his basic attacks boosted by his passive, thus Blade of Despair makes a great match with his passive. In this combination, Leomord really stands out as real ruthless low-HP targets butcher. In middle game, you are suggested to select among Wings of the Apocalypse Queen, Rose Gold Meteor and Berserker's Fury depending on the situation. Wings of the Apocalypse Queen and Rose Gold Meteor provide good durability while Berserker's Fury plus his passive could deal extremely high damage.",

Unlike Kagura that can only teleport once to her umbrella (because of the cooldown). But that does not mean Kagura cannot stand a chance against Harley. If Harley made his move first before Kagura, she will stagger and get low health before she can attack Harley. There are also cases that when Kagura threw her umbrella, Harley then used his 3rd Skill to Kagura, slowing her down and making her very vulnerable. Kagura can't use her 2nd Skill: Active 1 which is her jump that removes debuff when she doesn't have her umbrella. That's why be careful when fighting Harley.",
